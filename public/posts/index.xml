      <description>Intro Link to heading Those who thought Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) were an old shoe have been taught better with the offshoot `gRPC developed by Google.

In some projects of my past working life I also came across old SOAP APIs from time to time. Neither of them made me love RPC very much.</description>
